# Claric Engine Website Integration

## Purpose
This README provides guidance for integrating the Claric Engine product site (claricengine.com) with your main studio/company site (farshard.com).

---

## 1. Domain Setup
- Register claricengine.com (if not already done)
- Optionally register claricengine.dev, claricengine.io, claricengine.games for defensive purposes
- Set up 301 redirects from any old/unused domains to claricengine.com
- Use Namecheap for registration and DNS management

## 2. Website Structure
- **farshard.com**: Main company/studio site (about, team, portfolio, news, contact)
- **claricengine.com**: Dedicated product site for the engine (features, docs, downloads, support, dev blog)
- Link both sites in their respective headers/footers ("Visit our studio" / "Try our engine")
- Use a shared design system or branding elements for consistency
- Consider a subdomain for the engine docs: docs.claricengine.com

## 3. Integration Steps
- Add navigation links between the studio and engine sites
- Prepare a landing page for claricengine.com (can be a copy of the current template, with branding and content updates)
- Add a "Powered by Claric Engine" badge to the studio site

## 4. Domain Transfer/Value
- If you own thymosengine.com, you may keep it for legacy/SEO/redirect value or transfer it to another registrar if preferred
- Keeping both claricengine.com and thymosengine.com is valuable for brand protection and potential future use

## 5. Cost-Effective Domain Strategy
- Start with .com for Claric Engine
- Add .dev/.io/.games as budget allows or as the brand grows
- Defensive registration of common misspellings is recommended if budget permits

## 6. Next Steps
- Register claricengine.com and set up basic landing page
- Update farshard.com to link to the engine
- Set up 301 redirects as needed
- Begin integrating "Claric Engine" into codebase, docs, and marketing
